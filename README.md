#Unbottle yourself

I did this assignment at Monterosa so that I would learn to understand JavaScript more and understand JavaScript logic.

I choose to use HTML because I am used to work with the markup language. And it was a small project so it seemed to be the obvious choice.

I used Stylus because I like how clean it gets without the curly brackets, semicolons and colons.

And last i used Gulp as my build system because I'm used to working with it and I really enjoy the live reload.

I cloned the development enviroment from WBKD.

# Used frontend-starterkit from WBKD

[frontend-starterkit](https://github.com/wbkd/frontend-starterkit)

This webapp starterkit provides a prepared development environment based on [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp), [stylus](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).
